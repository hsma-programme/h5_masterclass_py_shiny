### Local Environment

The `environment.yml` file can be found within the `environment_file` folder. To install, please follow the steps below...

In the terminal/ command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the yml file and use the command:
```conda env create -f environment.yml```

To activate once installed use the command:
```conda activate hsma5_pyshiny```

When finished you can go back to the base environment using the command:
```conda deactivate hsma5_pyshiny```

### Web Environment

Nearly everything we do today can be completed on an interactive web environment online, [HERE](https://shinylive.io/py/examples/)

### Running Code Locally

For those who chose to run their code locally, we recommend VSCode as your IDE and also to create a new environment, specifically for Shiny.

### Practical exercises notebook

The exercise file can be found in `exercise\` directory. This exercise will be completed within your Peer Support Groups.
